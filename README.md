# HTML-CSS-Course
Learning HTML and CSS

Just me learning the HTML and CSS basics by following the youtube video "HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2022)" of "SuperSimpleDev"
the link to the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc

For info, this course has been taken from the tweet: https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421050888028160

In this course I made a copy of the youtube main page using only html and css code.
The main file of the repo is the youtube.html file. This file uses the style-icons-thumbnail folders.

There will be also some html files that are not a part of global purpose of the course but help understand different css techniques (grid, flex, position...). 
The main html file works without these files.
